# scRNA processing
This repository contains the jupyter notebooks and scripts I created to teach myself scRNA processing from raw FASTQ to a small meta data analysis.

First I used STARsolo to align raw FASTQ files to the genome. That tutorial is in scRNA_fastq_processing.ipynb

Then I used scanpy to analyze 3 individual samples. That tutorial is in scRNA_scanpy.ipynb
