# scRNA processing
This repository contains the jupyter notebooks and scripts I created to teach myself scRNA processing from raw FASTQ to a small meta data analysis.

First I used STARsolo to align raw FASTQ files to the genome. That tutorial is in scRNA_fastq_processing.ipynb

Second I performed quality control on a subsampled dataset. That tutorial is in scRNA_scanpy.ipynb

star 2.7.11b
python 3.12.3

All scripts run on my personal computer (Windows 10 with an 8 core CPU and 16 GB RAM).
